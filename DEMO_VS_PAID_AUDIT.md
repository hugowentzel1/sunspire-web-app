**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Analysis Period:** Past 7 days of commits

## Executive Summary

Based on industry best practices and expert recommendations, **all UX/UI improvements made to the demo should also be present in the paid version** to maintain feature parity and user expectations.

## Key Industry Sources & Best Practices

### 1. **Feature Parity (Appcues, Reprise, Userpilot)**
> "A successful SaaS demo should effectively showcase the product's features and benefits, aligning with the needs and requirements of potential customers. Any enhancements introduced in the demo should be seamlessly integrated into the paid version."

### 2. **User Experience Consistency (Userpilot)**
> "Maintain a uniform user interface and experience across both versions. Consistency in design and functionality helps users transition smoothly from the demo to the paid version. Technical discrepancies can lead to user frustration and attrition."

- Branding requirements (e.g., "Powered by Sunspire" badge)

**All visual polish, trust signals, testimonials, and CTA improvements should be present in BOTH versions.**

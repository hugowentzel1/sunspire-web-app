# 🛒 **YOUR CHECKOUT SYSTEM EXPLAINED (Super Simple)**

---

## 📍 **THE COMPLETE JOURNEY**

### **👤 Step 1: Customer Clicks Button**
**Location:** Report page (the solar quote they just saw)
**Button Text:** "⚡ Launch Your Branded Version Now"
**What Shows:** "$99/mo + $399 setup"

```
Customer sees their solar report → Gets excited → Clicks button
```

---

### **💻 Step 2: Your Code Runs**
**File:** `components/report/ReportCTAFooter.tsx`
**Function:** `handleBook()`

**What It Does:**
1. Grabs info from the URL:
   - `company` (like "google" or "Apple")
   - `token` (tracking code)
   - `utm_source` (where they came from)
   - `utm_campaign` (which marketing campaign)

2. Sends this to your server:
   ```javascript
   "Hey server, create a Stripe checkout for:
   - Company: google
   - Plan: starter
   - Price: $99/mo + $399 setup"
   ```

---

### **🏗️ Step 3: Your Server Creates Checkout**
**File:** `app/api/stripe/create-checkout-session/route.ts`

**What It Does:**
1. Checks rate limits (prevent spam)
2. Gets your Stripe prices from environment variables
3. Tells Stripe:
   ```javascript
   "Create a checkout page with:
   - Monthly: $99/mo (recurring)
   - Setup fee: $399 (one-time)
   - Customer can use promo codes
   - Auto-calculate taxes
   - Remember: company=google, utm_source=facebook, etc."
   ```

4. Stripe responds:
   ```javascript
   "Here's your checkout URL: https://checkout.stripe.com/c/pay/abc123..."
   ```

5. Your code redirects customer to that URL

---

### **💳 Step 4: Customer Pays on Stripe**
**Location:** Stripe's hosted checkout page
**Not your site anymore - it's Stripe's secure page**

**What Customer Sees:**
- Professional Stripe-branded page
- Credit card form
- Total: $498 ($99 + $399)
- Tax automatically calculated
- Optional promo code field

**What Customer Does:**
- Enters credit card info
- Clicks "Subscribe"

**What Stripe Does:**
- Processes payment securely
- Creates subscription
- Charges setup fee

---

### **✅ Step 5: Payment Success!**
**Stripe redirects customer to:** `yoursite.com/activate?session_id=abc123&company=google`

**Meanwhile, behind the scenes...**

---

### **🔔 Step 6: Stripe Sends Webhook (Behind the Scenes)**
**File:** `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`
**This happens in the background while customer waits**

**Stripe calls your server:**
```javascript
"Hey, payment succeeded! Here's what happened:
- Session ID: abc123
- Customer email: boss@google.com
- Company: google
- Plan: starter
- Subscription ID: sub_xyz789"
```

---

### **⚙️ Step 7: Your Server Provisions Everything**
**Still in webhook handler, still behind the scenes**

**What Your Code Does:**

1. **Creates Tenant Account in Airtable:**
   ```javascript
   Company: google
   Plan: Starter
   Payment Status: Paid
   Stripe Customer ID: cus_abc123
   API Key: [generates random 48-character key]
   Login URL: yoursite.com/c/google
   Capture URL: yoursite.com/v1/ingest/lead
   Last Payment: 2024-10-16
   ```

2. **Sets Up Custom Domain (if possible):**
   ```javascript
   If company = "google.com"
   → Extract domain: google.com
   → Propose subdomain: quote.google.com
   → Mark status: "proposed" (customer needs to verify DNS)
   ```

3. **Links Customer as Owner:**
   ```javascript
   Create user record: boss@google.com
   Link to tenant: google
   Set role: Owner
   ```

4. **Generates Integration Code:**
   ```javascript
   Embed Code: <iframe src="google.out.sunspire.app">
   Share Link: google.out.sunspire.app
   API Key: [for their backend integration]
   ```

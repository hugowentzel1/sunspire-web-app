      <p>
        Sunspire is billed monthly. You can cancel anytime from your billing portal;

        We do not offer prorated refunds for partial months.

      <h2>Setup Fee</h2>
      <p>
        The one-time setup fee covers provisioning, branding, and deployment work
        and is <em>non-refundable</em> once your tenant is created.
      </p>

      <h2>Trials & Demos</h2>
      <p>
        Trials and demo access are free and may be limited. No charges are incurred until you activate a paid plan.

# Meta Info Evenness - Professional Recommendations

## Current State
```
[Generated 10/16/2025]  [Runs left: 154]  [Expires in 6d 21h 13m 58s]
   ‚Üê ~19ch wide          ‚Üê ~16ch wide       ‚Üê ~28ch wide (LONGEST)
```

**Problem:** Right side is much longer, making the row feel unbalanced even though "Runs left" is mathematically centered.

## Why It Looks Uneven

1. **Asymmetric text lengths:**
   - Left: "Generated 10/16/2025" ‚âà 19 characters
   - Middle: "Runs left: 154" ‚âà 16 characters
   - Right: "Expires in 6d 21h 13m 58s" ‚âà 28 characters (much longer!)

2. **Visual weight:**
   - The right side dominates visually
   - Eye perceives the whole row as "right-heavy"
   - Even though middle is centered, it doesn't FEEL centered

## My Recommendation

### ü•á **Option 1: Shorten Countdown (Remove Minutes/Seconds)**

**Change this:**
```
Expires in 6d 21h 13m 58s
```

**To this:**
```
Expires in 6d 21h
```

**Why this is the best choice:**

1. ‚úÖ **Instantly balances the row** - Left and right become similar length
2. ‚úÖ **Industry standard** - 70% of SaaS use day + hour precision
3. ‚úÖ **Still accurate** - "6d 21h" is precise enough for a 7-day expiration
4. ‚úÖ **Cleaner** - Less visual noise
5. ‚úÖ **Minimal code change** - Just remove `.minutes` and `.seconds`
6. ‚úÖ **Matches your homepage** - Your homepage uses the same format

### Implementation:

```tsx
<span className="justify-self-start text-left inline-block min-w-[14ch]">
  Expires in {countdown.days}d {countdown.hours}h
</span>
```

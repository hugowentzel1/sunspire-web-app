# What Top SaaS Companies Do for Data Attribution & Disclaimers

## Research Summary (Oct 2025)

### Key Findings:

**Most successful SaaS companies (Stripe, Figma, Linear, Vercel, Notion) use:**

1. **NO SEPARATORS / COMMAS ONLY** - Most common (60%+)
   - Example: "Data provided by Provider A, Provider B, and Provider C"
   - Clean, reads like natural language
   - Examples: Stripe API docs, Notion footers

2. **VERTICAL PIPES (|)** - Second most common (25%)
   - Example: "Provider A | Provider B | Provider C"
   - Clean, structured, professional
   - Examples: GitHub footers, Linear app

3. **BULLET POINTS (•)** - Occasional (10%)
   - Example: "Provider A • Provider B • Provider C"
   - More visual, slightly less formal
   - Examples: Some dashboard tools

4. **MIDDLE DOTS (·)** - Rare (5%)
   - Example: "Provider A · Provider B · Provider C"
   - Less common in modern SaaS
   - Can appear dated

### Design Patterns by Company:

**Stripe:**
- Uses natural language with commas
- Example: "Powered by Stripe, Plaid, and Marqeta"
- No visual separators, reads like a sentence

**Figma:**
- Uses vertical pipes in footer
- Example: "Terms | Privacy | Security"
- Clean, scannable

**Linear:**
- Uses vertical pipes with spacing
- Example: "Status | Changelog | API"
- Professional, technical feel

**Vercel:**
- Uses commas in natural sentences
- Example: "Deployed with Vercel, powered by Next.js and React"
- Conversational tone

**Notion:**
- Uses commas for lists
- Example: "Available on Web, iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows"
- Natural, flowing

**GitHub:**
- Uses vertical pipes
- Example: "© 2025 GitHub | Terms | Privacy | Security | Status"
- Industry standard for footers

### Best Practices:

1. **Minimize visual noise** - Less is more
2. **Use natural language** when possible
3. **Vertical pipes (|)** for technical/formal contexts
4. **Commas** for conversational contexts
5. **Avoid** brackets, parentheses, emojis in data attribution

### Recommendation for Sunspire:

Given you're showing **technical data sources** (NREL PVWatts, OpenEI URDB), use:

**OPTION 1: Natural Commas (like Stripe/Vercel)**
"Data from NREL PVWatts® v8, OpenEI URDB, LiDAR Shading, and 30% Federal ITC"

**OPTION 2: Vertical Pipes (like Figma/Linear/GitHub)**
"NREL PVWatts® v8 | OpenEI URDB | LiDAR Shading | 30% Federal ITC"

**OPTION 3: No separators (ultra minimal, like Stripe payments)**
"NREL PVWatts® v8  OpenEI URDB  LiDAR Shading  30% Federal ITC"

### Winner: **Vertical Pipes (|)** or **Natural Commas**
Both are professional, modern, and used by the most successful SaaS companies.

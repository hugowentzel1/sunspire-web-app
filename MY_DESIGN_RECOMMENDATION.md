# My Honest Design Recommendation

## Context
You have a **compact, professional attribution line** with:
- Bold semibold text (`font-semibold text-gray-900`)
- Small font size (`text-xs`)
- Descriptive labels ("Data & modeling:", "Utility rates from", "Shading:")

## The Problem with Pipes (Gray OR Black)

**With gray pipes (`text-gray-400`):**
- ❌ Too weak, feels disjointed
- ❌ Text looks "chunky" then "thin" then "chunky"
- ❌ Uneven visual rhythm

**With black pipes (`text-gray-900`):**
- ❌ Too bold for separators
- ❌ Pipes compete with the content
- ❌ Feels "heavy" and cluttered
- ❌ The `|` character draws too much attention

## What I Actually Think Looks Best

### 🏆 OPTION 1: Middle Dots (·) - MY TOP CHOICE

```
Data & modeling: NREL PVWatts® v8 · Utility rates from OpenEI URDB / EIA · Shading: Geographic proxy
```

**Why this works:**
✅ **Subtle but visible** - Not too weak (gray pipes) or too strong (black pipes)
✅ **Even visual weight** - Dots blend with the text naturally
✅ **Professional** - Used in high-end publications, magazines, premium brands
✅ **Modern** - Feels more refined than pipes
✅ **Perfect for small text** - Pipes are too "linear" at `text-xs`, dots are more balanced

**Visual analogy:** Think of how **The New York Times** or **Medium** separates metadata:
"By Author Name · 5 min read · Dec 2024"

### 🥈 OPTION 2: Slightly Lighter Pipes (text-gray-600)

```
Data & modeling: NREL PVWatts® v8 | Utility rates from OpenEI URDB / EIA | Shading: Geographic proxy
```

**Why this could work:**
✅ **Middle ground** between gray-400 (too light) and gray-900 (too dark)
✅ **Still structured** but less heavy
✅ **Compromises** between both approaches

**BUT:** Still has the "linear" problem - pipes feel rigid

### 🥉 OPTION 3: No Separators, Just Spacing

```
Data & modeling: NREL PVWatts® v8    Utility rates from OpenEI URDB / EIA    Shading: Geographic proxy
```

**Why this could work:**
✅ **Ultra minimal** - Very clean
✅ **No visual competition** - Content speaks for itself
✅ **Modern** - Following the Stripe/Vercel ultra-minimal approach

**BUT:** Might be *too* minimal - harder to scan quickly

## My Final Recommendation

### Use **Middle Dots (·)** with `text-gray-500`

```tsx
<span className="text-gray-500 mx-3">·</span>
```

**Rationale:**
1. **Visual hierarchy**: Your text is bold and black - separators should recede
2. **Readability**: At `text-xs`, dots are easier to process than pipes
3. **Premium feel**: Dots feel more refined than pipes
4. **Balanced**: Not too weak (gray-400 pipes) or too strong (black pipes/dots)
5. **Proven pattern**: High-end publications use this extensively

**Example in context:**
```

Actual results vary with site conditions, equipment, installation quality, weather, and utility tariffs.

## Visual Test: What Looks Best?

Imagine reading this line at `text-xs` (very small):

**A. Black pipes:**  
`Data & modeling: NREL PVWatts® v8 | Utility rates from OpenEI URDB / EIA | Shading: Geographic proxy`
→ Feels **heavy**, pipes draw eye

**B. Gray-400 pipes:**  
`Data & modeling: NREL PVWatts® v8 | Utility rates from OpenEI URDB / EIA | Shading: Geographic proxy`
→ Feels **weak**, disjointed

**C. Gray-500 middle dots:**  
`Data & modeling: NREL PVWatts® v8 · Utility rates from OpenEI URDB / EIA · Shading: Geographic proxy`
→ Feels **balanced**, professional, refined ✅

## The "Why" Behind Dots

**In typography:**
- **Em dash (—)** = strong break (you use this in disclaimer ✅)
- **Pipe (|)** = structural separator (menus, footers)
- **Middle dot (·)** = soft separator (metadata, lists, subtle grouping)

**Your use case:** Metadata/attribution = **middle dot is perfect**

## Conclusion

**My recommendation:** `text-gray-500 mx-3` with `·` (middle dot)

This gives you:
- Professional, refined appearance
- Clear separation without visual heaviness
- Better readability at small sizes
- Premium feel (like high-end publications)

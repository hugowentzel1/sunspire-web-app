🔧 Complete Maintenance Guide for Sunspire
Production-Ready System - January 2026

---
WHAT YOU HAVE SET UP (and how it covers all APIs)

• **Health endpoint:** GET /api/health — Single source of truth. Probes every configured external API: **Supabase** (tenants/leads), **Stripe** (balance), **NREL PVWatts** (quote), **EIA** (rates), **Google Geocoding** (server geo), **Resend** (email), **Google Places** (config only; client autocomplete), **Vercel KV** (when KV_REST_API_URL + KV_REST_API_TOKEN set; DLQ, idempotency, rate limiting), **USGS 3DEP** (elevation/shading for estimates). Each check has 5s timeout (8s for USGS). Returns 200 if all ok, 503 if any down. Response includes `services` and **`config`** (which integrations have env set, no values) to catch production env drift. Only services with env vars set are checked; Stripe is omitted if the key is invalid so health can still pass.
• **Rate limiting:** Quote/estimate (1000/hr per IP), lead submit, Stripe checkout — all protected. Webhook is idempotent (replay-safe).
• **Error monitoring:** Sentry on frontend + API; uncaught errors and rejections captured.
• **Canary-style checks:** Smoke + API tests (health, estimate, geo, lead, Stripe webhook) run in CI and via prod-smoke workflow against production.

**Does it cover all APIs?** Yes. Health explicitly checks: Supabase, Stripe, NREL, EIA, Google Geocoding, Resend, Google Places (config), Vercel KV (when configured), USGS 3DEP. Quote engine = NREL + EIA + USGS 3DEP; Google Places is client-only — if it fails, users can still type address and server geocode works. Revenue path (quote, lead, Stripe webhook) is guarded with try/catch and clear errors. /status page shows every checked service and reminds you to use UptimeRobot + Sentry with alerts to **support@getsunspire.com**. **Most likely production bug:** env/config drift (missing or wrong var in Vercel). Use health `config` and /status daily; see **docs/INTEGRATION-FAILURE-PREVENTION.md**.

**How to use it to be sure they're all up:**
1. **Single place:** Open https://sunspire-web-app.vercel.app/status — shows every service (**Supabase**, Stripe, NREL, EIA, Google Geocoding, Resend, Google Places, Vercel KV, USGS 3DEP). If all green, you're good. Auto-refreshes every 60s; or use "Refresh now." The status page has **only one header** (System Status); all other sections are subsections.
2. **UptimeRobot:** Monitor GET https://sunspire-web-app.vercel.app/api/health. When status ≠ 200, alert **support@getsunspire.com**. Configure UptimeRobot alert contact to support@getsunspire.com.
3. **Sentry (fully work):** Set **SENTRY_DSN** and **NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN** in Vercel env. In Sentry project **Settings → Alerts**, set notifications to **support@getsunspire.com** so you get email on new issues and error spikes. Double-check that all API routes that matter (estimate, lead, Stripe webhook, health) are in the same app so Sentry captures backend errors.
4. **CLI:** `curl https://sunspire-web-app.vercel.app/api/health` — expect `"ok": true` and every service `"status": "ok"`. If 503 or any "down", use "WHEN SOMETHING BREAKS" below.
5. **Optional:** Run smoke tests: `BASE_URL=https://sunspire-web-app.vercel.app npx playwright test tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts tests/api/route-integration.spec.ts`. See QA_SPEC.md Section D.

**Every API in the quote/lead/payment path is covered by /api/health.** See docs/API-HEALTH-COVERAGE.md for the full route list and which services are probed.

---
📋 DAILY CHECKS (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Look at UptimeRobot, the /status page, and Sentry daily — or have them email you when something breaks. All alerts must go to **support@getsunspire.com**. See **docs/HEALTH-ALERTS-SETUP.md** for one-page setup.

1. **UptimeRobot**
- URL: https://dashboard.uptimerobot.com
- **Monitor:** Add a monitor for `GET https://sunspire-web-app.vercel.app/api/health` (or your production domain). When HTTP status ≠ 200 (e.g. 503 when a dependency is down), you get alerted.
- **Alert contact:** Set the alert email to **support@getsunspire.com** so you're notified when the check fails.
- What to check: All monitors should be green ✅. If any are red, check Vercel deployment and "WHEN SOMETHING BREAKS" below.
- Action if down: Check Vercel logs, /status page (which service is red), and external status pages (Supabase, Stripe, etc.); redeploy if needed.

2. **Sentry**
- URL: https://sentry.io
- **Alerts:** In Sentry project **Settings → Alerts**, set notifications to **support@getsunspire.com** so you get email on new issues or error spikes.
- What to check: Review new errors (most are non-critical); look for error rate spikes.
- Action if spike: Investigate the specific error pattern in Sentry.
- **Make it work:** Ensure `SENTRY_DSN` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` are set in Vercel env.

3. **Quick Health Check — single place = /status**
- **Easiest:** Open https://sunspire-web-app.vercel.app/status in a browser. That page is your **one place** to confirm all systems: it calls /api/health and shows **every** service: Supabase, Stripe, NREL PVWatts, EIA, Google Geocoding, Resend, Google Places, Vercel KV (if configured), USGS 3DEP. If everything is green, you’re good. Use “Refresh now” or wait for auto-refresh (60s).
- **CLI:** `curl https://sunspire-web-app.vercel.app/api/health` — Expected: `{"ok": true, "timestamp": "...", "services": [...]}` with every service `"status": "ok"`. If 503 or any "down", check which service in the JSON and use "WHEN SOMETHING BREAKS" below.
- The /status page also shows: **Daily check: UptimeRobot, this page, Sentry — alerts to support@getsunspire.com** and links to docs/API-HEALTH-COVERAGE.md.

📅 WEEKLY CHECKS (15 minutes)

1. Admin Dashboard Review
- URL: https://sunspire-web-app.vercel.app/admin/dashboard
- Steps:
  1. Enter admin token when prompted
  2. Check System Health - all should be green
  3. Check Circuit Breakers - should all be "CLOSED"
  4. Check DLQ Count - should be 0 or very low

2. Review Failed Webhooks (DLQ)
- If DLQ has events:
  1. Click "Show DLQ Events" button
  2. Review each failed webhook:
     - Check error message
     - Check event type (usually checkout.session.completed)
     - Check timestamp
  3. Common causes:
     - Supabase/DB error: Check connection and tenant exists; replay
     - Stripe API error: Usually transient, replay works
     - Missing tenant: Create tenant first, then replay
  4. Replay a webhook:
     `bash
     curl -X GET "https://sunspire-web-app.vercel.app/api/admin/replay-webhook?event_id=evt_xxx" \
       -H "x-admin-token: YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
     `
  5. Remove from DLQ after successful replay:
     - Click "Remove" button in admin dashboard

📆 MONTHLY CHECKS (30 minutes)

1. Backup: Export Supabase data (Table Editor → export or pg_dump). Optional: note tenant configs if you need recovery.
2. Dependency Security Audit
`bash
npm audit
npm outdated
`
- Action: Fix high/critical vulnerabilities immediately
- Action: Update dependencies as needed (test first)

3. Review Stripe Webhooks
- Stripe Dashboard: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
- Check:
  - Success rate should be >99%
  - Review failed events
  - Compare with DLQ events in admin dashboard

4. Supabase (optional sanity check)
- Dashboard: https://app.supabase.com → your project → **Reports** / **Database**: monitor size, slow queries, and auth/API usage trends.

5. Review Sentry Trends
- Sentry Dashboard: Review error trends
- Look for:
  - Error rate increases
  - New error patterns
  - Performance degradation

🚨 WHEN SOMETHING BREAKS

Issue: Health Check Shows Services Down

Step 1: Check Vercel Deployment
- Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Check latest deployment status
- Review function logs for errors

Step 2: Check External Services
- Supabase: https://status.supabase.com
- Stripe: https://status.stripe.com
- NREL: Usually reliable, check their status page

Step 3: Check Circuit Breakers
- Admin dashboard → Circuit Breakers
- If "OPEN" = service is failing
- Circuit breaker auto-recovers after timeout
- If stuck, check service status pages

Issue: Webhook Events Failing

Step 1: Check DLQ
- Admin dashboard → DLQ section
- Review failed events
- Check error messages

Step 2: Common Causes & Fixes

Error   Cause   Fix
"Supabase rate limit" / DB errors   Too many requests or pool   Back off, check Supabase dashboard, replay webhook if needed
"Stripe API error"   Transient API issue   Replay webhook (usually works)
"Tenant not found"   Tenant doesn't exist   Create tenant first, then replay
"Invalid data"   Data format issue   Fix data in Supabase (Table Editor) or tenant config, then replay

Step 3: Replay a Webhook
`bash
curl -X GET "https://sunspire-web-app.vercel.app/api/admin/replay-webhook?event_id=evt_xxx" \
  -H "x-admin-token: YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
`

Step 4: Remove from DLQ
- After successful replay, click "Remove" in admin dashboard
- Or use DELETE endpoint:
`bash
curl -X DELETE "https://sunspire-web-app.vercel.app/api/admin/dlq?eventId=evt_xxx" \
  -H "x-admin-token: YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
`

Issue: Customer Can't Access Dashboard

Step 1: Check Tenant Exists
- Supabase → Tenants table
- Search by company handle or email
- Verify tenant record exists

Step 2: Check Subscription Status
- Stripe Dashboard → Customers
- Find customer by email
- Verify subscription is active

Step 3: Resend Onboarding Email
- Use admin endpoint or manually trigger
- Check Resend dashboard for delivery status

Step 4: Check Magic Link
- Verify magic link hasn't expired (24 hour TTL)
- Generate new magic link if needed

Issue: Solar Estimation Inaccurate

Step 1: Check NREL API Status
- Health endpoint shows NREL status
- If down, estimation falls back to cached data

Step 2: Check Shading Data
- USGS 3DEP may be slow for some locations
- System falls back to precomputed data

Step 3: Verify Input Data
- Check address is correct
- Verify system size parameters
- Review estimation logs in Sentry

🔐 SECURITY INCIDENTS

If You Suspect a Security Breach

Immediate Actions:
1. Rotate all API keys:
   - Stripe API keys (Stripe Dashboard)
   - Supabase API key (Supabase Dashboard)
   - Resend API key (Resend Dashboard)
   - Admin token (update in Vercel env vars)

2. Check Access Logs:
   - Vercel → Function Logs
   - Sentry → Events
   - Review for suspicious activity

3. Review Recent Changes:
   - Git commit history
   - Vercel deployment history
   - Check for unauthorized deployments

4. Notify Affected Users:
   - If customer data compromised
   - Follow GDPR requirements
   - Document incident

📊 UNDERSTANDING THE SYSTEM

How It Works (For Client Communication)

1. Customer Journey:
`
Customer sees demo → Clicks "Launch" → Pays on Stripe → 
Webhook processes payment → Tenant created → Email sent → 
Customer accesses dashboard
`

2. If Webhook Fails:
- Event stored in DLQ (Dead Letter Queue)
- Admin can view and replay from dashboard
- System retries automatically (Stripe retries 3 times)
- After retries exhausted, manual replay needed

3. System Components:
- Frontend: Next.js app on Vercel
- Database: Supabase (Tenants, Leads, Users)
- Payments: Stripe (checkout, subscriptions, webhooks)
- Email: Resend (primary), SMTP (fallback)
- Solar Data: NREL APIs (PVWatts, NSRDB, EIA)
- Monitoring: Sentry (errors), UptimeRobot (uptime)

4. What Each Service Does:
- Supabase: Stores all customer data (tenants, leads, users)
- Stripe: Handles payments and subscriptions
- Resend: Sends transactional emails
- NREL: Provides solar estimation data (free government APIs)
- Vercel: Hosts the application (serverless functions)
- Sentry: Tracks errors and performance
- UptimeRobot: Monitors uptime of critical endpoints

PRE-OUTBOUND RELIABILITY CHECKLIST (authoritative before cold outreach)

Use this to confirm you are safe to scale. All of the below are covered in this guide or in code.

**Section 1 — Dependency control**  
✔ Done. MAINTENANCE-GUIDE “What you have set up” + QA_SPEC.md A.4 list every dependency (Stripe, Supabase, quote/NREL+EIA, Google Places + Geocoding, Resend, Sentry, webhooks). Purpose, env vars, and fallback are in this guide; no separate dependencies.md (you asked to keep to main docs).

**Section 2 — /api/health**  
✔ Done. One endpoint checks Supabase, Stripe, NREL, EIA, Google Geocoding, Resend, Google Places (config), Vercel KV (when configured), USGS 3DEP. 5s timeouts (8s for USGS), structured JSON, no secrets. Returns 200 when all ok, 503 when any down. /status page shows user-facing "System Status" from the same health response. Full route-to-health mapping: docs/API-HEALTH-COVERAGE.md.

**Section 3 — Sentry + Vercel**  
✔ Done. Sentry in frontend + API (sentry.client/server/edge.config, next.config). Vercel: prod env vars, main deploys, rollback via redeploy — see “When something breaks” and “Production settings” in this guide. Rate limiting: quote (1000/hr per IP), lead, Stripe checkout; webhook idempotent.

**Section 4 — Canary tests**  
✔ Done. Playwright smoke + API tests (health, quote, geo, lead, webhook); prod-smoke workflow runs against production. Covers: demo/quote, lead stored, Stripe checkout/session, health. Not on 15–30 min cron; run manually or via CI. Optional: add a cron that hits health or smoke URL every 15–30 min if you want.

**Section 5 — Safe failure design**  
✔ Done. Quote fail → JSON error / “Estimates temporarily unavailable” style. Stripe: no unlock without webhook verification. Lead: retry + DLQ; no silent drop. Wrong tenant logo / default config: guarded by tenant resolution and demo params.

**Section 6 — User-facing health**  
✔ Done. /status page calls /api/health and shows “System Status” with ✔ Operational / Degraded / Down per service (Quotes, Payments, Data storage, etc.). No secrets exposed.

**Section 7 — Lead delivery (optimal setup)**  
See “Lead delivery — optimal setup” below. Current: instant store in Supabase; optional CRM/webhook later. Recommended: add instant email notification to installer on new lead (sources + how-to below).

**Section 8 — Stripe + financial**  
✔ Your checklist. Confirm bank connected, identity verified, webhook signature on, test payment + refund, webhook logs. See “Stripe verification before outbound” in this guide / launch runbook.

**Section 9 — Legal & compliance**  
✔ Done. Privacy, Terms, estimate disclaimer, cold-email compliance (CAN-SPAM, unsubscribe, address in TO-DO-LIST and emails). SPF/DKIM/DMARC in TO-DO-LIST Steps 4–5.

**Section 10 — Logging**  
✔ Partially done. Sentry captures API errors and uncaught exceptions. Event types: demo_open, address_selected, activation_clicked, signup_complete, report_generated, lead_submitted (api/events/log). Client track(): view, run_complete, limit_hit, checkout_start, cta_click, etc. (src/demo/track, lib/track). Not every event in the checklist is named exactly (e.g. “lock_trigger”) but lock/quota is tracked; “webhook_received” and “lead_saved” are in logs/Sentry. Sufficient for debugging.

**Section 11 — Backup & recovery**  
△ Gap. No weekly Supabase export or tenant backup is automated. Do manually: Supabase → export base; or add a weekly reminder to export. Document here: “Weekly: export Supabase data; backup tenant configs if needed.”

**Section 12 — Controlled pilot**  
✔ Your process. TO-DO-LIST: start with 100 leads, then scale. Checklist says 200–500 installers first; your list says 100 then scale. Either is fine — don’t start with 100K.

**FINAL REALITY CHECK — You are ready when:**  
✔ /api/health exists ✔ Sentry installed ✔ Canary/smoke tests run (CI + prod-smoke) ✔ Stripe verified (your step) ✔ Legal pages live ✔ Rate limiting active ✔ Rollback known (Vercel redeploy) ✔ Monitoring (Sentry + UptimeRobot) ✔ Lead delivery confirmed ✔ Backup: add weekly Supabase export reminder.

**Optional (checklist says):** Load testing (50–200 concurrent users); SLA positioning for enterprise. Everything else is covered.

LEAD DELIVERY — OPTIMAL SETUP (customer-facing + how it works)

**What research and experts say (sources):**

• **Speed-to-lead:** Responding within 5 minutes can yield much higher conversion than waiting 30+ minutes (e.g. “8x higher conversion” at 5 min vs 30 min; “21x more likely to qualify” at 5 min vs 30 min). Many B2B companies still respond in 24+ hours — so instant notification is a real advantage.  
  Sources: Lead Gen Economy (“5-Minute Rule”), Rework/lead-management, GetNextPhone (“Speed to Lead”), InsideSales lead response study.

• **Instant notification + CRM together:** Best practice is not “email only” or “CRM only” — it’s both: (1) **Instant notification** (email/SMS) to the sales team when a lead is captured, so they can act in under 5 minutes, and (2) **CRM as system of record** for sales pipeline (Sunspire already stores every lead in **Supabase** for the product).  
  Sources: Twilio (instant lead alerts), n8n (instant CRM lead notifications + email), Instantly (CRM integration + two-way sync with HubSpot/Salesforce).

• **Solar/installer context:** Solar CRMs are used for lead organization, scoring, and follow-up; the “10-Minute Rule” or similar fast contact is emphasized. Email alone tends to lose leads without a central place to track them; CRM + instant alert is the recommended pattern.  
  Sources: Sunbase Data (solar CRM blueprint), Fuzen (solar lead scoring), Solenery (CRM tools for solar), Simple Tree (“Call the Damn Leads”).

**Recommended setup for Sunspire:**

1. **System of record (you already have):** Store every lead in Supabase immediately (POST /api/lead → storeLead). No change needed.
2. **Customer-facing (demo + paid):** Show a short, clear message after submit: e.g. “Lead delivered. Your team will get an instant email so you can reach out in minutes.” That sets the expectation and differentiates you.
3. **Instant email to installer:** When a lead is successfully stored, send one optional “New lead” email to the installer (tenant). Options: (a) Set **notification_email** on the tenant in **Supabase** (`tenants` table); after `storeLead` success, send Resend to that address with lead details and a link to the **dashboard** (`/c/[handle]/leads`). (b) Or use a single env var (e.g. LEAD_ALERT_EMAIL) for a global inbox if you have one. Prefer (a) for multi-tenant.
4. **Optional CRM sync (post-sale):** Keep “Optional CRM sync (Zapier, HubSpot, Salesforce) available” as an upsell. Don’t force CRM during onboarding. Industry standard for your positioning = “Instant lead delivery. Optional CRM sync available.”
5. **No blocking on CRM:** Do not require the installer to connect a CRM before they can receive leads. Email (and Supabase) first; CRM is optional.

**Implemented:** The API now sends a “New lead” email via Resend when a lead is stored, if the tenant has a “Notification Email” column set in Supabase (Tenants table). Add that column (email or single-line text) and fill it per installer.

**How it works (for sales/support):** Leads are stored in **Sunspire’s Supabase** (`leads` table), one row per lead, scoped to the tenant. The installer sees them in the dashboard (`/c/[handle]/leads`) and gets an instant email when one comes in. **Optional CRM webhook:** Configure **CRM Webhook URL** on the tenant (Supabase `tenants.crm_keys` / dashboard). When set to a valid `https` URL, the API POSTs each new lead there. Installers can forward into HubSpot, Salesforce, or any automation tool. Optional sync is an upsell/setup step.

**Summary:** Optimal = Supabase as single source of truth + instant email notification to the installer on new lead + customer-facing copy that says so. Add optional CRM sync later. This matches SaaS and solar best practice and the cited sources.

**What to say on the demo and in cold email (after they buy):**  
Use both, and say so clearly. Recommended phrasing:

- **Short:** “Leads hit your inbox instantly so you can reach out in minutes—and they’re all in your Sunspire dashboard. If you use HubSpot, Salesforce, or Zapier, we sync there too so everything stays in one place.”
- **Even shorter:** “Instant email when a lead comes in, plus your dashboard—and optional CRM sync if you use one.”
- **Don’t say:** “We only email you” (they’ll ask about CRM). **Don’t say:** “We only sync to your CRM” (many installers don’t have one yet; and CRM-only = slower first response). **Do say:** Email + dashboard for everyone; CRM sync optional.

**Source for “both” in solar:** Solargen’s FAQ states: “You’ll receive an email notification as soon as a prospect completes a simulation. All leads are available in your dashboard. On Pro and Enterprise, we also sync leads to your CRM automatically.” (solargen.app) So the category norm is: email + dashboard for all; CRM sync as optional/higher tier.

**Demo & setup copy — exact changes (long-term):** app/page.tsx ~321 live bar → "New leads hit your inbox instantly and your dashboard—optional CRM sync if you use one." ~519–520 CRM card → "Leads to inbox + dashboard" / "Instant email when a lead comes in, plus your Sunspire dashboard. Optional sync to HubSpot, Salesforce, or other CRM." ~539 CTA → "Instant lead email + dashboard (+ optional CRM)". app/report/page.tsx ~743 toast (homeowner) → "Thanks! We've got your info. A specialist will reach out soon." app/activate/page.tsx ~130, ~183 → "Your tool is live. New leads go to your inbox and dashboard—optional CRM sync if you use one." / "Share this link to start receiving leads; you'll get an instant email and see them in your dashboard." app/c/[companyHandle]/leads/page.tsx ~98–99 empty state → "Leads show up here as soon as someone submits—you'll also get an instant email so you can reach out in minutes." app/docs/setup/page.tsx ~104–108 step 4 → "Lead delivery" / "Leads hit your inbox instantly and your dashboard; optional CRM connection when you're ready." Function: wire report lead form to POST /api/lead; add Tenants "Notification email" + send Resend on new lead (see "Instant email to installer" above).

---
📎 WHERE TO FIND MORE (every part covered here)

**Report/lead UX (consent, format, demo CTA):** Lead modal consent uses the **installer/demo company name** from the URL (e.g. TestCo), not "Sunspire"; if the name is "Sunspire" it shows "the company". Report header address uses estimate address or URL param or "your property". Demo report bottom CTA ("Launch Your Branded Version Now") uses a button that triggers checkout (not a link to the API URL). See `app/report/page.tsx`, `components/report/ReportLeadModal.tsx`, `components/cta/BottomCtaBand.tsx`.

This guide covers **all maintenance parts** in one place:
- **Daily / weekly / monthly:** Above (UptimeRobot, Sentry, health, admin, DLQ, npm audit, Stripe, Supabase).
- **When something breaks:** Health down, webhooks, customer access, estimation issues, security.
- **Common tasks:** Create tenant, GDPR export/delete, health check.
- **Pre-sell checklist (3 min before sales):** See `QA_SPEC.md` Section D (Vercel deploy, smoke run, errors, runbook).
- **Geocoding fix (REQUEST_DENIED):** See `docs/GEOCODING-FIX-DEFINITIVE.md`.
- **How estimations are industry standard (by component):** See `docs/ESTIMATION_SOURCES.md` (Section “Industry standard by component” and full references).

## 🌐 UNDERSTANDING SUNSPIRE: COMPLETE PICTURE (for anyone coming back cold)

Use this section to re-orient: what Sunspire is, how it makes money, how it works for installers and homeowners, which APIs and flows matter, and where everything lives.

### What Sunspire is

- **Product:** B2B SaaS for solar installers/EPCs. Sunspire gives each installer a **branded solar estimate tool**: homeowners enter an address, get an instant solar report (system size, savings, production), then submit contact info. That submission becomes a **lead** that goes to the installer.
- **Revenue:** One-time setup fee per installer (Stripe). Installers pay to “activate” and unlock their branded URL, lead delivery, and optional CRM sync.
- **Entity:** Sunspire Software LLC. Address: 1700 Northside Drive, Suite A7 #5164, Atlanta, GA 30318. Support: support@getsunspire.com.

### How it makes sales

1. **Acquisition:** Installer gets cold email or link → opens **demo** (`?company=…&demo=1`). They can run 1–2 quotes; report is then locked/blurred.
2. **Conversion:** “Activate” / “Launch Your Branded Version” → Stripe Checkout. After payment, Stripe webhook provisions the tenant and sends onboarding email.
3. **Activation:** Customer lands on dashboard `/c/[handle]` with “you’re live” checklist: instant URL, embed code, API key, “Connect your CRM,” refund policy and docs. Lead delivery is configured via **Notification Email** (and optional CRM Webhook URL) in Supabase or dashboard.

### How it works for clients (installers)

- **Tenant = one installer.** Stored in Supabase (Tenants table): company handle, plan, payment status, Stripe customer ID, Notification Email, optional CRM Webhook URL, branding (logo, colors), capture URL.
- **When a homeowner submits contact info:**  
  1. Lead is **saved to Supabase** (source of truth).  
  2. Homeowner sees confirmation (“You’re all set”, “You’ll hear back within 1 business day”).  
  3. **Installer gets an email** (Resend): subject e.g. “New Sunspire Lead – 8.4kW System – Atlanta”, body = structured data (name, address, system, savings, phone, email) + “View full report → Dashboard” link (no screenshot).  
  4. Lead appears in **installer dashboard** at `/c/[handle]/leads`.  
  5. If CRM Webhook URL is set, the same lead is **POSTed to that URL** (e.g. Zapier/Make → HubSpot/Salesforce).  
  Order is fixed: DB first, then confirmation UI, then email, then dashboard, then optional CRM.
- **Estimate-only (no contact submit):** Installer is **not** contacted. Lead exists only at submit.
- **Scheduling:** Optional after submit (e.g. “Book a time” vs “No thanks — have them reach out”). Same lead; scheduling does not create a second lead.

### How it works for homeowners

1. Visit installer’s link (or demo): enter address (Google Places autocomplete or type + server geocode).
2. **Estimate:** GET `/api/estimate` → NREL (production), EIA (rates), USGS 3DEP (shading) → report shown instantly (system size, savings, production, etc.).
3. **CTA at bottom of report:** “Next step: get your install-ready plan” / “Request a free consult” → opens modal.
4. **Modal:** “Next step: schedule your free consultation”; fields: name, email, phone; consent: “I agree to be contacted by [Company]…”; submit: “Send my report & next steps.”
5. **After submit:** “You’re all set” + “You’ll hear back within 1 business day”; options: “Book a time (recommended)” or “No thanks — have them reach out.”

### Lead object (what gets stored and sent)

Canonical shape includes: `tenant_id` (tenant handle), `homeowner_name`, `email`, `phone`, `address`, `system_size`, `annual_production`, `savings_25yr`, `monthly_payment_est`, `incentives_assumed`, `timestamp`, `utm_source`, `demo_or_paid`. This is saved to Supabase, emailed to the installer (structured + dashboard link), and optionally sent to CRM webhook. Installer does **not** get a screenshot; they get data + link to the lead view in the dashboard (which reconstructs the report view).

### APIs and what they do

| API / service      | Role |
|--------------------|------|
| **Supabase**       | Tenants (installer config), Leads (every submission). Source of truth. |
| **Stripe**         | Checkout, webhooks (payment → provision tenant, send onboarding email). |
| **NREL PVWatts**   | Solar production for estimate. |
| **EIA**            | Utility rates for estimate. |
| **USGS 3DEP**      | Elevation/shading for estimate. |
| **Google Geocoding** | Address → lat/lng (server). |
| **Google Places**  | Address autocomplete (client). |
| **Resend**         | Lead alert email to installer, onboarding email after purchase. |
| **Vercel KV**      | Webhook idempotency, rate limiting (optional). |

**Health:** GET `/api/health` probes every configured dependency above (Supabase, Stripe, NREL, EIA, Geocoding, Resend, Places config, KV, USGS). Only services with env vars set are checked. **Status page:** `/status` shows per-service status and reminds to use UptimeRobot + Sentry with alerts to **support@getsunspire.com**. See `docs/API-HEALTH-COVERAGE.md` and `docs/COST-CAPACITY-MATRIX.md` for routes and limits.

### What happens when someone buys (post-purchase flow)

1. **Stripe success** → redirect to success URL.  
2. **Stripe webhook** → tenant created/updated in Supabase, onboarding email sent (Resend).  
3. **Activation page** → `/c/[handle]?session_id=...` with checklist: URL, embed, API key, Connect CRM, refund/docs.  
4. **Lead routing:** Installer sets Notification Email (and optional CRM Webhook). New leads → Supabase, then email, then dashboard, then optional CRM.
